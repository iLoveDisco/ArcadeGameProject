-- Minimum fuctionalities --

DONE - 1. One kind of monster with motion and which can kill players
DONE - 2. Monster can be inflated by the hero’s pump.
DONE - 3. Rocks that the player cannot move through


- Added monsters that can move around. If the hero touches the monster, then
  the console will print "Hero died"
  
- If the Player presses Z, then it shoots out the pump to it's right.
  The PDF specifications doesn't mention that the Hero needs to have a pump direction
  so we didn't implement it
  
- Hero is now bounded by the outerscreen of the game.
